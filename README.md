# DWT-CSP-EEG-classification
This is my thesis project. So only a few things have been done.

FYI: I provided both of .mlx file and .m file, they are the same code inside.

Method: We use Discrete wavelet transform(DWT) with Common spatial filter(CSP) as our feature extraction method.

Model: Hybrid Deep neural network, and pre-trained model with feature image classification
